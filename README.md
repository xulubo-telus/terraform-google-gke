# Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Module

This repo contains a [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) module for running a Kubernetes cluster on [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/)
using [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/).

## This Module includes the following submodules:

 * `gke-cluster`: The GKE Cluster module is used to administer the [cluster master](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-architecture)
for a [GKE Cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-admin-overview).

## What is Kubernetes?

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) is an open source container management system for deploying, scaling, and managing
containerized applications. Kubernetes is built by Google based on their internal proprietary container management
systems (Borg and Omega). Kubernetes provides a cloud agnostic platform to deploy your containerized applications with
built in support for common operational tasks such as replication, autoscaling, self-healing, and rolling deployments.

You can learn more about Kubernetes from [the official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/).

## What is GKE?

Google Kubernetes Engine or "GKE" is a Google-managed Kubernetes environment. GKE is a fully managed experience; it
handles the management/upgrading of the Kubernetes cluster master as well as autoscaling of "nodes" through "node pool"
templates.

Through GKE, your Kubernetes deployments will have first-class support for GCP IAM identities, built-in configuration of
high-availability and secured clusters, as well as native access to GCP's networking features such as load balancers.

## <a name="how-to-run-applications"></a>How do you run applications on Kubernetes?

There are three different ways you can schedule your application on a Kubernetes cluster. In all three, your application
Docker containers are packaged as a [Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/), which are the
smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, and represent one or more Docker containers that are tightly coupled. Containers
in a Pod share certain elements of the kernel space that are traditionally isolated between containers, such as the
network space (the containers both share an IP and thus the available ports are shared), IPC namespace, and PIDs in some
cases.

Pods are considered to be relatively ephemeral disposable entities in the Kubernetes ecosystem. This is because Pods are
designed to be mobile across the cluster so that you can design a scalable fault tolerant system. As such, Pods are
generally scheduled with
[Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/#pods-and-controllers) that manage the
lifecycle of a Pod. Using Controllers, you can schedule your Pods as:

- Jobs, which are Pods with a controller that will guarantee the Pods run to completion.
- Deployments behind a Service, which are Pods with a controller that implement lifecycle rules to provide replication
  and self-healing capabilities. Deployments will automatically reprovision failed Pods, or migrate Pods to healthy
  nodes off of failed nodes. A Service constructs a consistent endpoint that can be used to access the Deployment.
- Daemon Sets, which are Pods that are scheduled on all worker nodes. Daemon Sets schedule exactly one instance of a Pod
  on each node. Like Deployments, Daemon Sets will reprovision failed Pods and schedule new ones automatically on
  new nodes that join the cluster.

## How do I contribute to this Module?

Contributions are very welcome! Check out the [Contribution Guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions.


## How is this Module versioned?

This Module follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). You can find each new release, along
with the changelog, in the [Releases Page](../../releases).

During initial development, the major version will be 0 (e.g., `0.x.y`), which indicates the code does not yet have a
stable API. Once we hit `1.0.0`, we will make every effort to maintain a backwards compatible API and use the MAJOR,
MINOR, and PATCH versions on each release to indicate any incompatibilities.
